# Stepzly

Stepzly is a lib to perform stepped, predefined actions suitable to data transformation, aggregation, calculation and validation. 
It's part of a Low-Code BFF (Back for Front) solution, but can be used separately. It is designed to run on the server-side.

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Node.js 0.10 or higher is required.

If this is a brand new project, make sure to create a `package.json` first with
the [`npm init` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file).

Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```

## Features

  * Perform promise-based steps
  * Fetch data from external sources
  * Manipulate (set/unset) state and result
  * Convert data to and from string/number/date
  * Calculate data
  * Split/Join data
  * Extract data with regular expressions
  * Validate data with comparison and logical operators
  * Run loops based on lists with context
  * Define conditions for each step execution
  
## Desired Features for next versions

  * Implement common Authentication methods for Fetch (Basic, API key, Bearer, Basic auth, Digest, OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0)
  * Implement routines, wich is basically groups of steps that runs on the same context (e.g. a loop) and have similar conditions
  * Support more robust logging and instrumentation/telemetry
  
## Documentation and Wiki

  * Complete documentation coming soon! Check [Examples](#examples-and-quick-start) for Quick Start
  
## Examples and Quick-start

In `examples` folder you can have a bunch of scenarios using Stepzly capabilities. In examples Yaml is used to define Steps.

From Example 06:

````
steps:
  - set:
      to: githubOrg
      from: microsoft
    name: Define GH org
  - fetch:
      url: https://api.github.com/orgs/{{githubOrg}}
      to: ghOrgInfo
    name: Retrieve GH Org info
  - convert:
      from:
        - "{{ghOrgInfo.created_at}}"
        - "{{ghOrgInfo.updated_at}}"
      to:
        - ghOrgInfo.created_date
        - ghOrgInfo.updated_date
      conversion: toDate
    name: Convert Dates
  - calculate:
      from:
        - "{{ghOrgInfo.followers}}"
        - "{{ghOrgInfo.following}}"
      to: ghOrgInfo.follower_and_following
      operator: +
    name: Calculate Followers + Following
    conditions:
      - Has Followers:
          compare: "{{ghOrgInfo.followers}}"
          with: 0
          operator: greater
          logical: or
  - split:
      from: "{{ghOrgInfo.avatar_url}}"
      to: ghOrgInfo.avatarUrlFragments
      separator: /
    name: Separate Avatar Url Fragments
  - join:
      from: "{{ghOrgInfo.avatarUrlFragments}}"
      to: ghOrgInfo.avatarUnderlineUrl
      separator: _
    name: Join Avatar Url Fragments with underline
  - extract:
      from: "{{ghOrgInfo.avatar_url}}"
      to: ghOrgInfo.avatar_id
      expression: 'u\/(.*)\?'
    name: Extract Avatar ID
  - set:
      to: ghOrgInfo.avatar_id
      from: "{{ghOrgInfo.avatar_id.1}}"
    name: CleanUp Regex
  - validate:
      compare: "{{ghOrgInfo.followers}}"
      with: 0
      operator: greater
      to: ghOrgInfo.has_followers
    name: Validate Org followers

The author of Stepzly is [FÃ¡bio Luiz Pereira](https://github.com/fabio-luiz-pereira).

I began the development a few years back, but in 2022 revised and shaped into a library

Current looking for contributors to help adding new features!
